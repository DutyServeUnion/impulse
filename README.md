# Welcome to impulse

## History
Impulse is a semi-serious roleplay framework designed by vin (Jake Green) for Apex-Roleplay's Black Mesa gamemode and Half Life 2 gamemode after that. Impulse is the predecessor to Apex-Roleplay's version of Classic Half-Life 2 roleplay base. Impulse was created in an attempt to update  the in-efficient and dated code of Classic Half-Life 2 Roleplay's base, and in the process add new features like an inventory system and character customization. In contrast to the Classic Half-Life 2 roleplay's base impulse is not a derivative of any other gamemode/framework. After Apex-Roleplay's closed in 2018 independent development has continued intermittently.
