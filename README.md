## History
impulse is a semi-serious roleplay framework designed by vin (Jake Green) for Apex-Roleplay's Black Mesa gamemode and Half Life 2 gamemode after that. Impulse is the predecessor to Apex-Roleplay's version of Classic Half-Life 2 roleplay base. Impulse was created in an attempt to update  the in-efficient and dated code of Classic Half-Life 2 Roleplay's base, and in the process add new features like an inventory system and character customization. In contrast to the Classic Half-Life 2 roleplay's base impulse is not a derivative of any other gamemode/framework. After Apex-Roleplay's closed in 2018 independent development had continued intermitenally until Jan 2019 when vin started full work again on the framework, recoding almost all the elements previously implemented. Since 2019 development has rapidly continued with several core features and goals being reached, all of which are documented in dev logs which are posted at www.vingard.ovh. In March 2019 aLoneWitness joined to help with the HL2RP schema. In May 2019 private tests occured. Since May 2019 work has continued and has been focused heavily on the inventory system.
