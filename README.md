# Welcome to impulse
Impulse is a framework designed by TheVingard (Jake Green) for Apex-Roleplay. It is made to be super-lightweight, easy to program in and great for working with databases.

## Working with impulse
If your working with impulse I reccomend you read the wiki first, feel free to DM me on discord if you have any questions.

## Features
1. Lightweight - impulse does not load what's not needed, and it's optomized.
2. Plugin system - A super simple plugin system is used, put sv_ sh_ or cl_ in the name!
3. Schema based - The schema system keeps your shit away from my shit.
4. Database automation - Lua>Database>Lua>Player, it dosen't get easier than this.
5. Wiki - We have a wiki.
6. Developer tools - Download the plugin here.
7. Simple networking - Networking is less of a hassle with impulse. We have a built in 'IVar' system that makes entity networking easy, and IMessages are planned to be added soon.
