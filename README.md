# Welcome to impulse
Impulse is a framework designed by TheVingard (Jake Green) for Apex-Roleplay. It is made to be super-lightweight, easy to program in and great for working with databases.

## Working with impulse
If your working with impulse I reccomend you read the wiki first, feel free to DM me on discord if you have any questions.

## Features
1. Lightweight - impulse does not load what's not needed, and it's optomized.
2. Plugin system - A super simple plugin system is used, put sv_ sh_ or cl_ in the name!
3. Schema based - The schema system keeps your shit away from my shit.
4. Database automation - Lua>Database>Lua>Player, it dosen't get easier than this.
5. Wiki - We have a wiki.
6. Developer tools - Download the plugin here.
7. Simple networking - Networking is less of a hassle with impulse. We have a built in 'IVar' system that makes entity networking easy, and IMessages are planned to be added soon.
8. Plugin permissions - (Maybe) If I release this to the public I will add a plugin permission system, the server owner must grant the plugin permissions in-game via a VGUI or in the schema config for the plugin to do things like, write to DB, read from DB, set usergroups, ban, get IP addresses, load external files, create files and make HTTP posts.
9. basicadmin - Not required, but very much recommended. A ultra-lightweight and simple admin mod that intergrates nicely into the gamemode, if GExtention is detected it will run off that, if not some features will be disabled. In the schema you can create the sh_admin.lua file in the config file to completely change the plugin for your schema.
10. XML table and 3D2D interaction built in libraries to make it easier to work with.
